# DSG-Entry-Data-Science-Competition
My kernel submission for Mushroom Dataset which has been given as a problem for analysing as a part of DSG Entry data science competition!
Problem Statement

The dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The aim of this problem is to identify the poisonous and edible class.
